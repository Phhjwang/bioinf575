Exercise

Count the number of digits in a large integer number:
e.g.: for the number 784512346 your code should return 9

Peptides are short chains of between two and fifty amino acids, linked by peptide bonds. Chains of fewer than ten or fifteen amino acids are called oligopeptides. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide

We have a text containing a series of peptides separated by space.

peptides_sequence = "MAAGGSGAESAPPTPSMSSLPLAALNVRVRHRLSLFLNVRTQVAADWTGLAEEM NFEYLEIRRLETHPDPTRSLLDDWQGRPGASVGRLLELLAKLGRDDVLVELGPS IEEDCRKYILKQQQEAAEKPLQVDSVDSSIPWMSGITIRDDPLGQMPEHFDAFI CYCPSDIQFVQEMIRQLEQTNYRLKLCVSDRDVLPGTCVWSIASELIEKRCRRM VVVVSDDYLQSKECDFQTKFALSLSPGAHQKRLIPVKYKSMKKEFPSILRFITV CDYTNPCTKSWFWTRLARALSLP"
Write python code to compute:

The number of Glutamine elements in the third peptide.
The sequence of the third peptide with the first 4 and last 4 characters swapped.
The number of peptides starting with Methionine

Change the following code to compute the :

Ratio of hydrophobic (A, V, L, I, M, F, W) to hydrophilic residues:
len(peptides_sequence)
##### # Solution:</b>

##### Start with the first simple part of the expression and 
##### then build to the whole expression step by step
# Use the count to count the occurence of an amino acid 
# and the occurence of space and len to get the total amino acid count
 
Exercise

We have four variables and a range for each: temperature (25 - 28 C), pH (6-8), pressure (29.8 - 30.2 inHg), no_cells (50-100)

If 2 of the variables are not in the correct range the cell culture does not grow.

Write an expression that gives a True/False answer and checks if the cell culture grows. Test it with 2 sets of values, one where the answer is True and one where the answer is False.

a) Count the number of sentences in the following text from a news article in Science (science.org):
https://www.science.org/content/article/jumping-gene-may-have-erased-tails-humans-and-other-apes-and-boosted-our-risk-birth-defects

Mammals from mice to monkeys have tails. But humans and our cousins the great apes lack them. Now, researchers may have unearthed a simple genetic change that led to our abbreviated back end: an itinerant piece of DNA that leapt into a new chromosomal home and changed how great apes make a key developmental protein. The finding also suggests the genetic shift came with a less visible and more dangerous effect: a higher risk of birth defects involving the developing spinal cord.

Advanced PCR Primer Evaluation

Create a complex expression to evaluate a potential PCR primer sequence of exactly 20 nucleotides. The expression should return True if all of the following conditions are met:

The sequence is valid (contains only A, T, C, G)
GC content is between 40% and 60% (inclusive)
It ends with a G or C (GC clamp)
It doesn't have more than 3 consecutive identical nucleotides
The last 5 nucleotides have at least 2 G or C bases
Test your expression with:

"ATCGATCGATCGATCGATCG"
"GCGCTATAGCGCTATAGCGC"
##### # Solution:</b>

##### Start with the first simple part of the expression and 
##### then build to the whole expression step by step
